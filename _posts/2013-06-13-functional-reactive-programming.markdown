Mid May, I gave a talk at [NodePDX][nodepdx] on [functional reactive
programming][frp] in JavaScript. I discussed the general ideas behind
the programming paradigm and various implementations that exist.  The
[video][video] is finally available online and the [slides][slides] are
also available.

Here's some links to the various different approaches to functional
reactive programming:

*   [Flapjax][flapjax]
*   [Reactive Extensions (RxJS)][rxjs]
*   [Shafty][shafty]
*   [Javelin][javelin]
*   [Bacon.js][bacon]
