Integrated directly into IntelliJ, Filibuster can show you the RPCs that your service is making and directly inject faults on any of those RPCs. Attach a debugger, inject some faults, and see what your application does!

Not only just GRPC (as shown here), we also support HTTP, Redis, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, and DynamoDB.
