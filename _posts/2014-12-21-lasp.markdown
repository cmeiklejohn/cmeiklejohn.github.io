_As we discussed in our first [post][part1], [Derflow][derflow] is the
now former name of our distributed deterministic programming model that
is the basis of our research into providing a more expressive way of
working with CRDTs and eventual consistency._

I've just returned from a one week vacation in Louvain-la-Neuve,
Belgium, where I spent the week working with [Peter Van Roy][pvr] at
[Université catholique de Louvain][ucl] on what was formally referred to
as [Derflow][derflow].  It was an amazingly productive week where we had
a chance to iterate on the model, prototype some new features, and fix a
selection of bugs.

# Highlights

* We renamed the programming model.  Derflow wasn't the greatest name in
  the world and was a product of focusing on the research over
  marketing.  Inspired by Lisp, short for list processing, we've chosen
  Lasp as the new name for Derflow, following the same pattern for
  deriving the name: Lasp for lattice processing.
* Pushed 59 commits, which resulted in over 6,000 additions and 4,000
  removals, closing twelve GitHub issues.  This work can be viewed on
  [GitHub][github].  This involved both new feature work and bug fixes.
* Loïc Schils, a graduate student at UCL will be doing his master's
  thesis, supervised by Peter and I, on our programming model and will
  begin contributing to the project in January 2015.
* Viet Bui, a graduate student at UCL, supervised by Peter and Manuel
  Bravo, will be looking at doing explicit causality in our programming
  model as well for his master's thesis.
* Adrian Colyer highlighted our work on his [blog][blog].
* Peter convinced me that [lightning has struck four times][lightning],
  in the same place.

It was an amazing week, and I can't wait to return in January.
