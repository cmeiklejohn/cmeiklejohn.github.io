Pushed out a new prototype Filibuster feature tonight: ðŸŽ‰ use Filibuster's IntelliJ plugin to get a "health check" of your microservice's functional test suite. ðŸŽ‰ 

Here, I can quickly open the plugin after running my test suite and see what RPC methods my service is exposing, how many unique functional tests I have covering those methods, how many specific Filibuster tests I have for those, and how many tests were automatically generated using Filibuster to exercise unique fault injection scenarios: where I injected HTTP and GRPC faults.
