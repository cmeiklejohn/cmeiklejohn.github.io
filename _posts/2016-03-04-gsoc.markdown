We are pleased to announce that the [BEAM
Community](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5748418722922496/)
has been accepted into the 2016 Google Summer of Code.

That means you can submit a project proposal to help develop the
[Lasp](https://lasp-lang.org) programming language for distributed
computing, mentored by me!

There's plenty of work to do, and I'd be happy to take on eager students
looking to help build the future of distributed computation.  Some of
the ideas we're looking include the following, but are not limited to:

* Partial evaluation, or how we can optimize programs based on access
  patterns between distrubuted data items.
* Optimization of CRDTs, or how we can leverage state of the art techniques
  in CRDT to reduce the amount of state transmission on the wire.
* Large-scale simulation, or how we can simulate large edge networks and
  the language implemented across them.
* Compilers, syntax, semantics!
* More!

Make sure you will be eligible to the project before writing your
proposal. Details are available on the [GSOC 2016
FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#students).
Please reach out to me via
