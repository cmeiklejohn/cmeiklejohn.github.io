Today, I'm pleased to announce the beta launch of my new project, called
[Proceedings][proceedings].

To put it simply, [Proceedings][proceedings] is your graduate school
reading group, brought online using video chat.

As a gradaute student, I've noticed a few things regarding
existing reading groups:

* Lack of archival; if you miss a meeting, you have no way to get a good
  handle on the discussion that happened.
* Lack of participants; people forget, people get lazy and computer
  science departments are small and may not have many students that
  share similar interests.

So, what are the ultimate goals of the service?

* Provide a way for users all over the globe to participate in
  discussions about interesting academic papers.
* Provide archived recordings of these discussions so they can be viewed
  by anyone, at any time.
* Allow anyone to register a reading group on a particular topic, and
  start having discussions.
* Make it dead simple, so you don't have to worry about coordination of
  paper selection and organization of members at a specific time.
* Providing a way for people in industry to participate with academics
  and have meaningful discussions.

[Proceedings][proceedings] is a direct spin off of the [Think
Distributed Podcast][thinkdistributed], based on feedback from our many
listeners.  Because of this, we'll be running a limited invitation only
beta focusing on distributed systems literature.

Head on over to [Proceedings][proceedings] to check it out and sign up
for the beta, we're aiming to have our first discussion on November
15th.
