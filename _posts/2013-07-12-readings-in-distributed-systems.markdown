_This post is a work in progress._

Inspired by a recent purchase of the [Red Book][redbook], which provides
a curated list of important papers around database systems, I've decided
to begin assembling a list of important papers in distributed systems.
Similar to the Red Book, I've broken each group of papers out into a
series of categories, each highlighting a progression of related ideas
over time focused in a specific area of research within the field.

Keeping the tradition of the Red Book, I've included both papers which
resulted in very successful systems and/or techniques, as well as papers
which introduced a concept which was either immediately dismissed or
proven incorrect.  This emphasizes the progression of ideas which lead
to the development of these systems.

## Consensus
